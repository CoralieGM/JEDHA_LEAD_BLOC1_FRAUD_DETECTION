# Automatic Fraud detection

Fraud is a huge issue among financial institutions. In the EU in 2019, the European Central Bank estimated that fraudulent credit card transactions amounted more â‚¬1 billion! ðŸ˜®

AI can really help solve this issue by detecting fraudulent payments in a very precise manner. This usecase is actually now one of the most famous one among Data Scientists.

However, eventhough we managed to build powerful algorithms, the hard thing is now to use them in production. This means predict fraudulent payment in real-time and respond appropriately.

## Project Goals

- Create an fraudulent payment detector using any AI library that you know of.
- Create an infrastructure that ingest real-time payment
- Automatically classify each payment and send back this prediction in real-time to a notification center
